# Pose-Detection
Here I have created a basic pose detection model using tf and tf hub libraries

Make sure you have tf and tf-hub installed in your pc

For Tensorflow:
# Requires the latest pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Current stable release for CPU and GPU
pip install tensorflow

# Or try the preview build (unstable)
pip install tf-nightly


For Tensorflow-HUB

$ pip install "tensorflow>=2.0.0"
$ pip install --upgrade tensorflow-hub
